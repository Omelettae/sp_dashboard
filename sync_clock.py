"""Boot-time clock step. Runs as root, once, before the sensor service.

The Pi has no RTC and no internet, so ``fake-hwclock`` restores whatever time
was saved at shutdown. This asks the backend PC for the real time and steps the
system clock, which is what makes Pi logs and file mtimes meaningful. The
running sensor app does NOT do this - it keeps a software offset instead, so
the clock is never stepped underneath a live sampling schedule.

``timedatectl`` only accepts whole seconds, so this correction is coarse. That
is fine; the software offset provides the fine correction.

Always exits 0: a Pi that cannot reach the PC must still boot and start
collecting (the readings get their true timestamps reconstructed later).
